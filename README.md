# React TypeScript Practice Project

This project is a comprehensive React application built with TypeScript, demonstrating various React concepts, hooks, and Apple-inspired styling principles. It serves as a learning playground for understanding React fundamentals, component architecture, and modern CSS techniques.

## Features

The project includes three main applications:

1. **Todo App**

   - Demonstrates basic state management with `useState`
   - Shows effect handling with `useEffect`
   - Implements local storage persistence
   - Features smooth animations and transitions

2. **Voting App**

   - Showcases complex state management with `useReducer`
   - Implements the Context API for state sharing
   - Demonstrates dynamic progress bars and calculations
   - Features responsive design and animations

3. **Form App**
   - Implements form validation with custom hooks
   - Shows proper form handling techniques
   - Demonstrates error handling and user feedback
   - Features Apple-inspired form styling

## React Concepts Demonstrated

- **Hooks**

  - `useState` for basic state management
  - `useEffect` for side effects and lifecycle events
  - `useReducer` for complex state logic
  - `useContext` for state sharing
  - `useCallback` for function memoization
  - `useMemo` for value memoization
  - Custom hooks for reusable logic

- **TypeScript Integration**

  - Type definitions for props and state
  - Interface declarations
  - Generic types
  - Type safety in hooks

- **CSS Concepts**
  - CSS Variables (Custom Properties)
  - Flexbox and Grid layouts
  - Transitions and Animations
  - Responsive Design
  - Apple-inspired styling principles
  - Modern CSS features

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app

## Learning Points

### React Hooks

- Learn how to manage state with `useState` and `useReducer`
- Understand side effects with `useEffect`
- Master context management with `useContext`
- Optimize performance with `useCallback` and `useMemo`

### CSS Techniques

- Implement Apple's design principles
- Use modern CSS features like Grid and Flexbox
- Create smooth animations and transitions
- Build responsive layouts
- Style forms and interactive elements

### TypeScript

- Define interfaces and types
- Use generics
- Implement type safety
- Handle events with proper types

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Component Organization**

   - Logical component structure
   - Separation of concerns
   - Reusable components

2. **State Management**

   - Appropriate use of different state management techniques
   - Context API for global state
   - Local state for component-specific data

3. **Form Handling**

   - Controlled components
   - Form validation
   - Error handling
   - User feedback

4. **Styling**

   - Modular CSS
   - CSS variables for theming
   - Responsive design
   - Accessibility considerations

5. **TypeScript**
   - Strong typing
   - Interface definitions
   - Type safety
   - Generic types
